          Ghana boasts a breathtaking 560 km coastline along the Atlantic Ocean, a vital resource with multifaceted significance. Beyond its picturesque beauty, this coastal stretch plays a crucial role in fisheries, climate regulation, biodiversity promotion, and transportation. Despite its importance, there is a pressing need to raise awareness about safeguarding this invaluable resource, especially among the younger generation.

          Bridging the Educational Gap
          </h1>
          <p className="w-1/2 mx-auto text-pink-100 text-lg">
          Regrettably, the importance of our coastline is often overlooked in the education system. From preschool to senior high school, there is a conspicuous absence of ocean-related subjects. As a result, students graduate without fundamental knowledge of the ocean, its impact on daily life, and the imperative to protect it. This educational gap contributes to the ongoing abuse of our ocean and a lack of collective will, even among our leaders, to prioritize its conservation.
